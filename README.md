### Setting up the environment

In the top right corner of each section, there is a gear button that will allow you to access the settings for that piece of code. We're going to make a few modifications to make sure our environment is ready for the code we are about to write.

#### CSS Settings

- Select "None" as the type of CSS.
- Select "Reset" to reset style and elminiate browser inconsistancies.
- Select "Prefix free" so you don't have to worry about vendor prefixes.
  - This doesn't matter too much for what we are doing but if you start experimenting towards the end, it may help.
